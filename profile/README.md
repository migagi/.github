## 👋 Welcome to Our Homelab & Cloud Exploration Zone!

This organization is all about experimenting with cool technologies in a homelab environment, with a special focus on Spring Boot and Spring Cloud applications.

- 🙋‍♀️ Everything you see here "runs" in a personal homelab.
- 🌈 We have a "production" namespace chugging away in Kubernetes.
- 🍿 You'll find multiple Spring Boot and Spring Cloud apps deployed and being tested.

We're always learning and building. Stay tuned for more! ✨
